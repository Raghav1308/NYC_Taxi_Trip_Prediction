Predicting NYC Taxi trip duration-

To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.
In this competition, we are challenged to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.
